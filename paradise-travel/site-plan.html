Park entrance fees are $6.50 plus $26 for a guide, guides are not required by the park but are a very good idea as tourists can be victims of robberies if not accompanied.  This is a perfect day trip for those who love the outdoors. This is a moderately strenuous hike but not long. For those who need a little extra help there are horses you can ride for about $20. Make sure to wear good shoes as there are lava rocks on the path and they will get in sandals and they are sharp!<br>

It has a sculpture of the níspero (Locquat in English) fruit and you can buy marmalades and syrups made from the fruit here.

            Chichicastenango Market<br>
            Mercado de Chichicastenango is well known as colorful and open air as well as possibly the craft largest market in Central America. Vendors from all over the region come to sell their products. From typical clothing to pottery to local food, this market is sure to have something for everyone.  Open every day but Thursday and Sunday are the largest with the most vendors. The streets are wall to wall with people.  It is expected that you haggle for a final price so don’t accept the first offer. Take a walk outside the market of Chichi, as the locals call it, and you'll find the Roman Catholic Iglesia de Santo Tomas. This church is not only where locals participate in Maya rituals on the steps but also home to the Chichicastenango Regional Museum.<br>
            Panajachel (largest town on Lago Atitlan)<br>
            Panajachel rests on the shore of Lake Atitlan and is full of culture, restaurants and a street market. This is a major launching location for the lanchas that cross the lake to take locals and tourists alike to the other villages that surround the lago Atitlán.<br>
            Iximche (mayan ruins)<br>
            A Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican archaeological site, you may see religious sacrifices being made, if so be respectful, steer clear and stay quiet.<br>
            Cayala<br>
            A city within a city, Cayala is a gated multi purpose community with white walled buildings, a high end hotel, restaurants and shops as well as homes<br>
            Hobbitenango<br>

About 20 minutes outside Antigua, you can get a reservation for both entrance and a ride to the park at the office on 3a Avenida Norte. There is plenty of adventure to be had and houses to see so give yourself a few hours to enjoy it all.
