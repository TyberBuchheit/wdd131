            <h1>Day Trips</h1>
            <h2>Within an hour drive from Antigua Guatemala are several amazing day trips to grab your <br>attention. If you love shopping, Chichicastenango offers local hand crafted items. If <br>outdoor adventure is what you're looking for, the active volcano Pacaya hike will provide <br>a thrilling ascent with beautiful views.  While there you can cook pizza on hot lava rocks <br>headed by the volcano. Travel back hundreds of years as you visit the Mayan ruins of <br>Iximche where you can learn history from a local tour guide who will take you back to a <br>time of high stakes games where the team who loses also loses their heads. Sit lake side <br>as you take in the views from the beaches of Lago Atitlan, the deepest lake in Central <br>America.  Come find your paradise in and around Antigua Guatemala!</h2>

                    <h4>One of 3 active volcanoes in Guatemala, Pacaya reaches 8,400 feet above sea level and sits about 30 <br>miles outside of the city Antigua. Get your reservation to eat pizza cooked with lava rocks heated by <br>the volcano. Park entrance fees are $6.50 plus $26 for a guide, guides are not required by the park but <br>are a very good idea as tourists can be victims of robberies if not accompanied.  This is a perfect day <br>trip for those who love the outdoors. This is a moderately strenuous hike but not long. For those who <br>need a little extra help there are horses you can ride for about $20. Make sure to wear good shoes as <br>there are lava rocks on the path and they will get in sandals and they are sharp!</h4>
